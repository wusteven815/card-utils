# Notice

Initially, I had this in an GitHub organization where I save privated repositories. I'm bringing it here for a while as validation of its existence and what I claim about it. If you have any questions about the private version (with all the commit history), I would love to explain its history and functions.

As such, there is significantly less documentation than I would've preferred
